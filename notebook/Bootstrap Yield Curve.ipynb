    "\n",
    "You might try:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$PV = \\frac{\\$100}{1.034} + \\frac{\\$100}{1.0328^2} + \\frac{\\$1100}{1.033^3} = \\text{???}$$\n",

    "### 1.2 What Markets Actually Quote\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the key insight: **markets don't quote discount factors directly**. They quote *par swap rates*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **par swap rate** is the fixed rate that makes a swap worth exactly `$0` at inception. It's a very specific number that depends on *all* the discount factors from year 1 through the maturity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about what the 3-year swap rate of 3.30% actually represents:\n",
    "- It's the rate where paying 3.30% fixed for 3 years is \"fair\" compared to receiving floating\n",
    "- It reflects an *average* of the term structure, weighted by when cash flows occur\n",
    "- It is NOT the \"3-year zero rate\" - it's something more complicated\n",
    "\n",
    "> **⚠️ Bloomberg:** Tickers like `USSO10 Curncy` quote **par swap rates**, not zero rates. Even screens labeled \"yield curve\" often show par rates unless you specifically select a different rate type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 The Translation Gap\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is a **translation gap**: markets give us one thing (par swap rates), but to price instruments, we need something else (discount factors).\n",

    "<table align=\"left\">\n",
    "<tr><th>What We Have</th><th>What We Need</th></tr>\n",

    "\n",
    "**Why can't we just convert directly?**\n",
    "\n",
    "If there were a single interest rate $r$ for all maturities, we could use:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$DF(T) = \\frac{1}{(1+r)^T}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "But there isn't one rate - there's a whole curve of rates! And the par swap rates we observe are *derived from* the discount factors, not the other way around. They're already \"baked\" with information about the entire curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get discount factors from par swap rates, we need to *invert* the relationship. This is what **bootstrapping** does.\n",
    "\n",

   "source": "---\n\n## 2. The Language of Discounting\n\nBefore we solve the translation problem, we need to understand what we're translating FROM and TO.\n\n### 2.1 Discount Factors: The Universal Translator\n\nA **discount factor** answers: *\"What is `$1` received at time T worth today?\"*\n\nIf the 1-year interest rate is 5%:\n- `$1` today grows to `$1.05` in 1 year\n- `$1` in 1 year is worth `$1` ÷ 1.05 = `$0.9524` today\n\nThe discount factor for 1 year is **0.9524**.\n\n**Key properties of discount factors:**\n- Always between 0 and 1 (future money worth less than today's)\n- Decrease with time (more distant = less valuable)\n- $DF(0) = 1$ exactly (money today is worth full value)\n\n**Why discount factors are \"universal\":** Every fixed income calculation - bond pricing, swap valuation, derivatives - ultimately reduces to multiplying cash flows by discount factors:\n\n$$PV = \\sum_{t} \\text{Cash Flow}_t \\times DF_t$$\n\n### 2.2 The Two Rate Types You Must Know\n\nThis is the critical distinction that confuses many practitioners. There are two fundamentally different ways to quote interest rates:\n\n---\n\n**Par Rate = Swap Rate** (What Markets Quote)\n\nThese terms are interchangeable:\n- The fixed rate that makes a swap worth `$0` at inception\n- Reflects a *weighted average* across all coupon periods\n- What Bloomberg quotes (USSO* tickers)\n- What you see on trading screens\n\nWhen someone says \"the 10-year swap rate is 3.75%,\" they mean the 10-year **par rate**.\n\n---\n\n**Spot Rate = Zero Rate** (What Bootstrapping Produces)\n\nThese terms are interchangeable. You'll hear both in practice:\n- **\"Spot rate\"** — emphasizes *today's* rate for that maturity (the \"spot\" price of money)\n- **\"Zero rate\"** — emphasizes it's the yield on a *zero-coupon* bond\n\nBoth mean exactly the same thing:\n- The rate for a single cash flow at maturity\n- The \"pure\" rate for that specific tenor, with no coupon averaging\n- Relationship to discount factors: $DF(T) = \\frac{1}{(1 + z_T)^T}$\n\n**Bootstrapping produces spot/zero rates.** Starting from par swap rates, the algorithm extracts the spot (zero) rate for each maturity.\n\n---\n\n**Example with numbers:**\n\n<table align=\"left\">\n<tr><th>Tenor</th><th>Par Rate (= Swap Rate)</th><th>Spot Rate (= Zero Rate)</th><th>Difference</th></tr>\n<tr><td>1Y</td><td>3.40%</td><td>3.45%</td><td>+5 bp</td></tr>\n<tr><td>5Y</td><td>3.42%</td><td>3.47%</td><td>+5 bp</td></tr>\n<tr><td>10Y</td><td>3.75%</td><td>3.84%</td><td>+9 bp</td></tr>\n<tr><td>30Y</td><td>4.11%</td><td>4.24%</td><td>+13 bp</td></tr>\n</table>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n\nNotice: **Spot rates are higher than par rates** (for upward-sloping curves). The gap widens with tenor.\n\n> **⚠️ Bloomberg:** In Terminal, the default \"Rate Type\" is often par. To see spot/zero rates: `YCSW0490 Index CRVF <GO>` → Rate Type dropdown → select \"Zero Rate\".\n\n### 2.3 Why Par and Spot Rates Differ\n\nThink about a 3-year par swap paying 3.30% annually.\n\nThe swap has cash flows at years 1, 2, and 3:\n- Year 1 coupon is discounted at the 1-year rate\n- Year 2 coupon is discounted at the 2-year rate\n- Year 3 coupon is discounted at the 3-year rate\n\nThe 3.30% par rate is a **weighted average** of these different rates, where earlier periods (with higher discount factors) get more weight.\n\nThe 3-year spot rate, in contrast, is the **pure** rate for a single cash flow at year 3 - no averaging.\n\n**Analogy:** \n- Par rate = average speed for a road trip (includes stop signs and highways)\n- Spot rate = instantaneous speedometer reading at the destination\n\n### 2.4 The Mathematical Fingerprint\n\nThe relationship between par and spot rates provides a reliable \"fingerprint\":\n\n**For an upward-sloping curve:**\n$$\\text{Spot Rate} > \\text{Par Rate} \\quad \\text{(at the same tenor)}$$\n\n**The gap pattern:**\n- Small at short tenors (~1-2 bp at 2Y)\n- Larger at long tenors (~15-25 bp at 30Y)\n\n**Why?** When the curve slopes upward, later coupons are discounted at higher rates. This \"pulls down\" the par rate relative to the pure spot rate. The effect accumulates with tenor.\n\n**The test:** If you're given rate data and need to identify whether it's par or spot:\n1. Bootstrap from the par rates\n2. Compare bootstrapped spot rates to the original data\n3. If they match → you have spot rates\n4. If spot rates are higher → you had par rates\n\nThis test will be demonstrated in Section 5.\n\n**Special Case: The Flat Curve**\n\nWhen the yield curve is flat (same rate at all maturities), something elegant happens:\n\n$$\\text{Par Rate} = \\text{Spot Rate} = \\text{Forward Rate}$$\n\nWhy? If every maturity has the same rate $r$:\n- Spot rate at any tenor is just $r$\n- Par rate is the weighted average of identical rates = $r$\n- Forward rate between any two periods is $r$ (no slope to amplify)\n\nThis is why academic papers often assume flat curves for simplicity: *\"The risk-free yield curve is assumed to be flat at 5%, so the forward curve is also flat at 5%.\"*"

    "## Part III: The Payoff — Forward Rates\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. What the Curve Tells Us About Future Rates\n",
    "\n",
    "We've learned to extract discount factors and zero rates from par swap rates. Now for the payoff: **forward rates** - what the curve tells us about future interest rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1 The Question Forward Rates Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "A **forward rate** answers questions like:\n",
    "- *\"What 1-year rate does the market imply for a loan starting in 2 years?\"* (the \"2y1y forward\")\n",
    "- *\"What overnight rate is implied for 5 years from now?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "Forward rates are **not predictions** - they're mathematical consequences of today's zero rates. They represent the rate at which you could lock in borrowing/lending for a future period using today's instruments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.2 The No-Arbitrage Argument\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight is **no-arbitrage**: investing for 3 years at the 3-year zero rate must equal investing for 2 years at the 2-year rate, then reinvesting for 1 year at the (implied) forward rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(1 + z_2)^2 \\times (1 + f_{2,3}) = (1 + z_3)^3$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $z_2$ = 2-year zero rate\n",
    "- $z_3$ = 3-year zero rate  \n",
    "- $f_{2,3}$ = 1-year forward rate starting at year 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why must this hold?** If it didn't, you could profit risk-free by borrowing at one rate and lending at another. Arbitrageurs would quickly trade away the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.3 The Forward Rate Formulas\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving for the forward rate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_{t_1, t_2} = \\left( \\frac{(1 + z_{t_2})^{t_2}}{(1 + z_{t_1})^{t_1}} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{t_2 - t_1}} - 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Or equivalently using discount factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_{t_1, t_2} = \\left( \\frac{DF_{t_1}}{DF_{t_2}} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{t_2 - t_1}} - 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Both formulas give the same answer - use whichever is more convenient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.4 Worked Example: The 2y1y Forward\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's calculate the 1-year forward rate starting in 2 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Given** (from our bootstrapped curve):\n",
    "- $z_2$ = 3.32% (2-year zero rate)\n",
    "- $z_3$ = 3.35% (3-year zero rate)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1:** Calculate growth factors\n",
    "- $(1 + z_3)^3 = (1.0335)^3 = 1.1039$\n",
    "- $(1 + z_2)^2 = (1.0332)^2 = 1.0675$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2:** Find implied 1-year growth from year 2 to 3\n",
    "- $(1 + f_{2,3}) = \\frac{1.1039}{1.0675} = 1.0341$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3:** Extract forward rate\n",
    "- $f_{2,3} = 1.0341 - 1 = 0.0341 = 3.41\\%$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:** The 2y1y forward rate is 3.41%. This means:\n",
    "- You could lock in today a 1-year loan starting 2 years from now at 3.41%\n",
    "- This rate is *higher* than both the 2Y and 3Y zero rates (characteristic of upward-sloping curves)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.5 Interpreting Forward Rates\n",
    "\n",
    "**Forward rates are \"marginal\" rates:** They represent the incremental rate for extending the loan one more period. For an upward-sloping curve, they're higher than the corresponding zero rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Forward rates amplify the curve slope:** A small upward slope in zero rates becomes a larger slope in forward rates. This makes forwards useful for:\n",
    "- Detecting market expectations about rate changes\n",
    "- Pricing Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs)\n",
    "- Understanding the \"term premium\" embedded in longer rates\n",
    "\n",
    "> **⚠️ Bloomberg:** Forward curve functions (e.g., `FWCV`) are available in Terminal. Be aware that forwards are highly sensitive to interpolation methodology - small differences in the zero curve can produce larger differences in forwards."

    "> **⚠️ Bloomberg:** The BQL function `curvemembers('YCSW0490 Index')` returns curve **inputs** (par swap rates), not outputs. To get bootstrapped zero rates or discount factors, you must either bootstrap yourself or access Bloomberg's pre-computed curves with appropriate licensing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A Note on Terminology**\n",
    "\n",
    "When practitioners say \"priced off the forward curve,\" they usually mean discounting using the curve's discount factors—not applying forward rates directly.\n",

    "- Pricing Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs)\n",
    "- The instantaneous rate $r(t)$ in continuous-time PDEs\n",
    "\n",
    "The phrase \"forward curve\" is often loose jargon for \"the yield curve\" in general. All four representations (par, DF, zero, forward) contain the same information—practitioners just pick the most convenient form for their task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.5 Risk-Free vs. Risky Curves\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Where $s_T$ is the credit spread at tenor $T$ (from CDS markets or bond spreads).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then derive risky discount factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$DF^{\\text{risky}}_T = \\frac{1}{(1 + z^{\\text{risky}}_T)^T}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight:** The formulas are identical. \"Risky\" just means different input rates—the bootstrapping math doesn't change.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use which:**\n",
    "- **Risk-free curve:** Discount collateralized cash flows, derivative valuations\n",
    "- **Risky curve:** Discount cash flows subject to issuer default (corporate bonds, loans)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.6 Compounding Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "Our tutorial uses **annual compounding**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$DF_T = \\frac{1}{(1 + z_T)^T}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Many academic papers and PDE-based models use **continuous compounding**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$DF_T = e^{-z_T \\cdot T}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Converting between conventions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an annually compounded rate $z_{\\text{ann}}$, the equivalent continuously compounded rate is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z_{\\text{cont}} = \\ln(1 + z_{\\text{ann}})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And vice versa:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z_{\\text{ann}} = e^{z_{\\text{cont}}} - 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:** When you see \"the risk-free rate is 5% with continuous compounding,\" this means $z_{\\text{cont}} = 0.05$, so $DF_1 = e^{-0.05} = 0.9512$. With annual compounding at 5%, $DF_1 = 1/1.05 = 0.9524$."
